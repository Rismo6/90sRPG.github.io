  <p> The Kleinmann's tortoise: You walk to the gate. You look up and see doors so big that you cant see the top. You attempt to open the gate. You try to push but it doesnâ€™t work. You try to pull but it doesn't. You pull harder and hard. 
</p>
      <p> The Kleinmann's tortoise: It starts to crack. The doors bust open and creatures that seem to look like shadows surround you! They close in. They get closer and closer. They are at arms reach! </p>
      <p> The Kleinmann's tortoise: BEGONE</p>
      <p> The Kleinmann's tortoise: The The Kleinmann's tortoise shines a light and destroys them all! What do you think you should do next?</p>
